## Abstract 3D level-based runner game with level selector.  
`C#` `Unity` `Game Design` `UI`

This is a runner style game I made when I was 15 years old. I was inspired by the aesthetic of games like SUPERHOT, Clustertruck etc. My focus was on level design, taking heavy consideration on introducing gameplay, balancing difficulty and immersion.
